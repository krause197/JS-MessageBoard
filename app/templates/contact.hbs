<p>We actively monitor our message boards for inappropriate comments.  That being said, this is a site for soldiers.  Swearing and inappropriate language are allowed, and at times even encouraged.  The only content that we will delete are OPSEC violations, ie. Dates and Locations of training events or National Guard Operations.  Everything else is fair game!</p>
